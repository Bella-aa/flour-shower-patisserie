# FLOUR SHOWER PATISSERIE

For my **Portfolio 1 Project** on the **Code Institute Diploma in Software Development (E-Commerce Applications)** course I have created a website called FLOUR SHOWER PATISSERIE that provides easy beginner baking recipies to people of all ages.

  The websit was sent to a group of 30 people and was tested on different devices. The users found the website easy to navigate and functional.Some of the device used during the testing process are:

  - Samsung Galaxy S8+
  - S20 Ultras
  - iPad mini

  ### Browser testing

  The Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and firefox. On all the browsers the website was tested, functionality and responsiveness is good. 

  ### Validators 

  The website was tested using Jigsaw W3C validation.  This showed  minor opening and closing tag errors which were fixed immediately.  An error came up in relation to the embeded iframe code from YouTube.  This code was adjusted and the error removed. Also an error for label and id's for the input elements showed up and they were fixed immediately.  Once the errors were fixed validator didn't display any errors in  html nor css.

### Responsiveness 

To check responsiveness I used Google Chrome Dev Tools.  Desktop, Mobile and tablet sizes were tested.  The website responded well.

###  Result: Chrome Lighthouse

### Color Contrast Testing 

I used [a11y](https://https://color.a11y.com/) to test the color contrast on the website which showed no contrast issues.

### Issues/Bugs Fixed 

The main issue I fixed was the horizontal scrolling of the website on different media screen devices. I used media queries to resolve this issue and it was gone.There were also white extra spaces between the elements  within the webpage on smaller devices for example on the S20 Ultra and Iphone12 pro. These extra spaces were caused by caused by padding so I used media queries to adjust the padding values on different small devices.The input fields were not symetrically aligned on smaller devices so I used media queries to resolve this by adjusting the font size of the label elments.


### Issues Unresolved

I was not able able to fix the chrome extensions that affected the lighthouse perfomance of the website, hence why the website has poor performance.

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- Pages were created along with assets folders and css style file. 
- As I worked I previewed changes using ports to open the browser.
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub
