                    <strong>Preheat oven to 190•C and ready your baking tray lined with parchment paper.</strong>

                <ol class="text">
                    <li> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt).
                    </li>
                    <li> For the wet ingredients, crack egg into a separate bowl, whisk and gradually mix in buttermilk.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using a box grater, grate the frozen butter. Try to do this as quickly as possible so the butter
                        does not become soft.</li>
                    <li> Now add the butter into the flour. Mix and ensure the butter distributes evenly. The mixture
                        should look like a soft bread crumbs.</li>
                    <li> mix in the wet ingredients. Fold in to form a sticky dough. Please, be careful not to over work
                        the dough to avoid ending up with tough scones.</li>
                    <li> Flour a working surface and transfer the dough on to it.</li>
                    <li> Dust your hands with some flour and gently pat down dough to about 1 inch thick. Cut using a
                        cookie cutter. You may also use a round glass or plastic cup if you do not have the cookie
                        cutter. Place on prepared baking tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Egg wash and bake for 12-15minutes or until it's golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven, let them cool and they are ready to serve.</li>
                    <li>Serve with your favorite spread <strong>(Optional).</strong></li>

                    <strong>Note: if you're making your own buttermilk, I will advice you make it earlier, so you're
                        able to chill it before use. Leave it out on a counter after adding the lemon juice to sit for
                        about 15minutes. Then refrigerate for use when your ready. It can last up to 5days in the
                        refrigerator.</strong>
