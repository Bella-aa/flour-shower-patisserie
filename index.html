            Today's Recipe: Easy Scones recipe.
        </h1>

        <p class="text">
            Today we are doing a simple and easy recipe for making scones. For this recipe you are going to need:
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Ingrediants</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (440g)</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons baking powder(20g)</li>
            <li>1 ½- 2 tablespoons sugar(35g) (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons Salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 sticks, unsalted butter chilled (180g)</li>
            <li>1  cup chilled buttermilk (240ml)</li> 
            <li>1 small egg (optional)+ 1 more for brushing</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading-3">Directions</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Preheat oven to 190•C and ready your baking tray lined with parchment paper.
        </p>

        <ol class="text">
            <li> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together  dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt).</li>
            <li> For the wet ingredients, crack egg into a separate bowl, whisk and gradually mix in buttermilk </li>
            <li>Using a box grater, grate the frozen butter. Try to do this  as quickly as possible so the butter does not become soft.</li>
            <li> Now add the butter into the flour. Mix and ensure the butter distributes evenly. The mixture should look like a soft bread crumbs</li> 
            <li> mix in the wet ingredients. Fold in to form a sticky dough. Please, be careful not to over work the dough to avoid ending up with tough scones.</li> 
            <li> Flour a working surface and transfer the dough on to it.</li>
            <li> Dust your hands with some flour and gently pat  down dough to about 1 inch thick. Cut using a cookie cutter. You may also use a round glass or plastic cup if you do not have the cookie cutter. Place on prepared baking tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Egg wash and bake for 12-15minutes or until it's golden brown.</li> 
        </ol>

        <p class="text">Note: if you're making your own buttermilk, I will advice you make it earlier, so you're able to chill it before use. Leave it out on a counter after adding the lemon juice to sit for about 15minutes. Then refrigerate for use when your ready. It can last up to 5days in the refrigerator. </p>
